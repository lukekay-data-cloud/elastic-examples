# With No Taxis Available, FORMBOOK Goes Cab-less

## Abstract
On September 7, 2021, Microsoft confirmed a vulnerability for the browser rendering engine used in several applications such as those within the Microsoft Office suite. Within 3 days, proof-of-concept code was released, highlighting the maturity of the exploit development ecosystem - underscoring the importance of proactive threat hunting and patch management strategies.

Based on telemetry, we observed this exploit used in conjunction with the FORMBOOK information stealer, we also identified an adversary tradecraft oversight that led to us connecting, what appeared to be, campaign testing infrastructure and a FORMBOOK phishing campaign targeting manufacturing victims with global footprints.

This post details the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of this campaign. Our goal is to enable detection capabilities for security practitioners using the Elastic Stack and any readers concerned with the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability or campaigns related to FORMBOOK.
